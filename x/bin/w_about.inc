In 2009 Kevin Kelly raised the notion that all goods and services are candidates for rental, sharing and the social commons; that access is better than ownership. In the current world where volatility and change are the only permanent traits, it is of paramount importance for businesses and individuals to own as little as possible, keeping in mind that owning goods/services that may be rendered incompetent tomorrow will only be of loss to them.<br><br>
We at Wavuh have taken this to the next level. We believe that businesses need to focus on their core business in order to reap best benefits. We also believe that in order to achieve this these businesses need to improve on their efficiency and effectiveness.
We have therefore put together a software facility that allows these businesses (and individuals too) to access (and not own) this efficiency at the most cost effective manner while concentrating on building their business profile.<br><br>
This software facility is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planner) that brings together all the faculties of a businesses, such as customers & sales, finance & human resource management and supply chain in an comprehensively integrated manner.<br><br>
We provide you, the business, with access to your own online company profile that is universally accessible and secure while we take care of your information (sorting, cataloging, backup and storage).  We allow you to run your company in a global village while interacting with other like minds and an unlimited customer base.<br><br>
The modules available in the Wavuh ERP include:
<ul>
<li>Human Resource Manager and Payroll – these two modules allow the business to understand their staff well enough and to manage them well so as to drive their businesses forward.<br></li>
<li>Customer Management (CRM) – this module helps the business to manage its customers from the point of them being a potent deal, right to the closing of the deal and the subsequent transactions leading to a sale. We also have a point of sale sub-module to facilitate better client management.<br></li>
<li>Supply chain – this module provides the business with a facility to procure for inventory and assets and have these managed (inventory management) in the company in an open and efficient manner.<br></li>
<li>Finance Management – the business will manage its monies, both income and expenditure through this module. It provides a comprehensive ledger with an effective reporting system.</li>
</ul>
