Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. Go to the login page and click Forgotten password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.

<a id="L2"></a><b>Why can't I log in?</b><br/>
Have you registered? Seriously, you must be registered by the HR officer(s) in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the HR officer or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the HR Offcer or administrator.

<a id="S1"></a><b>How do I change my profile?</b><br/>
Your profile (if you are registered) is stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (or on your username in any list page). This will allow you to change all your information.

<a id="U1"></a><b>What are Administrators?</b><br/>
Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating staff members, controlling the board security, style, etc. They also have full capabilities of the staff members, in all sections.

<a id="U2"></a><b>What are Section coordinators?</b><br/>
Section coordinators are individuals whose job it is to look after the running of the sections from day to day. Like the staff members, they have the power to edit or delete posts and close, re-open, move, and delete tickets in the section they are responsible for. Generally coordinators are there to help users, to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.
